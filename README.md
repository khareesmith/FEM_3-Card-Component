## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a showcase of my current skills with web development and my first with coding from a design and style guides. Generally speaking, this project was not very difficult. I did learn a bit about using custom CSS properties, which was employed with the naming of the different colors in the project for easy re-use.

Also one of my first uses with Flexbox and using a CSS reset to allow for easier styling from the start. Using a mobile-first approach significantly improved completing the project in a manner I was happy with.

```css
:root {
    --sedan-orange: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
    --suv-blue: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);
    --lux-blue: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);
    --light-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
    --white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I will seek to use a lot of the tools I have used in this project (ie. Flexbox, CSS custom variables) for further development. One of my goals in the future will be to streamline the process for coding. There were several hiccups along the way that could be solved with a better workflow.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox in 20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc&t=1018s) - This helped me understand Flexbox pretty quickly. It only covered a lot of basics, but was crucial for the styling.
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io) - I used this to quickly see the changes to my webpage as I coded. Was very crucial while I figured out my media query for desktop devices.
